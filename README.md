#####Body#####

1. To all thoſe that love the Lord Jeſus in Power and Spirit, of my Friends, with whom I walked in the outward form: As well my profeſſing Relations (after the fleſh) with all elſe unto whom theſe preſents ſhall come, that have any breathings after the precious Truth and life of God, Grace, Mercy and Peace be multiplied; the everlaſting love, life and truth of God dwell richly in you, &c.

    _ How to come to the foundation, and build thereon; and how to know in the light of God, when the ſoul has built on the ſure foundation.

    _ The inward pure Government and ſhining glory, and requirings in the houſe or habitation of God in the Spirit.

    _ Of the heavenly bread and waters of life that is provided, eat and drank of, in the family and houſe of God, in the Spirit of the living God.

    _ Of the inward adorning, and beautifying of Gods Houſe.

    _ The precious Laws of Government in Gods Houſe, and the choice Anointings and Teachings by the Spirit.

    _ No Lordly and Majeſtical Superiority in Gods houſe.

    _ A brief diſcovery of the entrance into this houſe and habitation of God.

    _ A word to the Weak, to eſtabliſh and direct them, that they faint nat, at the ſight of the outward Adverſary in their Meetings.

    _ Some further diſcovery of Gods houſe or habitation through the Spirit; And, according to my meaſure, declaring of the ſpiritual Temple or Tabernacle, and Ark of the Teſtimony; the Truth, Life and Subſtance of the Temple or Tabernacle, and Ark of the Teſtimony under the Legal diſpenſation, to be read in the light, which manifeſls the things that are of God.
